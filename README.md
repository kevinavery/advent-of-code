# Advent of Code

These are my Scala solutions for the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) programming puzzles.

Compared to other solutions that are extremely minimal and focused, I favor slightly more verbose code that is broken 
into reusable parts which are easier to read and test (for fun, each solution includes some basic unit tests).
